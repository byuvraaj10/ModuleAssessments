Step 1: Project Setup  
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.  
2. Create a folder named "sample-project" and navigate into it.  
3. Initialize a new Git repository.  
4. Create a new repository on GitHub called "sample-project".  
5. Link your local repository to the GitHub repository using the provided remote URL.  
6. Create a `README.md` file with the text "# Sample Project", add it to Git, commit the changes, and push them to the `main` branch on GitHub.  

Step 2: Modifying the README.md File  
1. Create a new branch named "feature/update-readme" and switch to it.  
2. Open the `README.md` file in a text editor and add the following content:  
   - "# Sample Project"  
   - "This project demonstrates Git and GitHub workflows."  
3. Save the changes, stage them, commit with a meaningful message, and push the branch to GitHub.  

Step 3: Merging Changes  
1. Open GitHub and create a pull request for the "feature/update-readme" branch.  
2. Add a description to the pull request and submit it.  
3. Review the changes and merge the pull request into the `main` branch.  

Step 4: Cleaning Up the Feature Branch  
1. Switch back to the `main` branch in your local repository.  
2. Delete the "feature/update-readme" branch locally.  
3. Remove the "feature/update-readme" branch from the GitHub repository.
